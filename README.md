# What is Blurred?
You might be asking right now, what is Blurred? Blurred is a social media platform created by BlurrMC. This platform is a 7 second long video app. It lets you see what is trending, what the people you follow post, and lets you upload a video. There are no algorithms to make it so that anyone that is trending is simply trending regardless of who they are or what they are doing. All videos posted are in a 4:3 ratio. There are no songs included for you to pick from and the only way to add sounds is by using an external application. This is a different social media platform compared to other ones like Tik Tok as an example. We have a more in depth web application system and is typically better as it is not sent to the Chinese government. Blurred is fully self-hosted and is not depending on external providers like AWS or Asure for the most part.
